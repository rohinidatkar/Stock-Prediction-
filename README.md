# Stock Prediction Project
Project Overview
The Stock Prediction Project aims to leverage advanced machine learning techniques to predict stock price movements and trends. By analyzing historical data and incorporating various market indicators, the project seeks to provide accurate forecasts that can inform investment decisions and trading strategies.

Objectives
Historical Data Analysis:

Collect and preprocess historical stock price data from various sources.
Analyze patterns and trends in historical data to identify key factors influencing stock prices.
Feature Engineering:

Develop and select relevant features (e.g., moving averages, trading volume, economic indicators) that impact stock prices.
Implement feature scaling and transformation to improve model performance.
Model Development:

Experiment with different machine learning models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, neural networks, LSTM).
Optimize model parameters and architecture for the best predictive performance.
Model Evaluation:

Assess the models using appropriate metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²).
Validate the models with out-of-sample data to ensure robustness.
Visualization and Interpretation:

Visualize stock price trends, predicted vs. actual prices, and other relevant metrics.
Interpret the model results to provide actionable insights.
Project Workflow
Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Utilize yfinance to download historical stock data for selected tech stocks (AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, AMZN).
Clean the data by checking for null values and duplicates.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyze the change in stock price over time using line plots.
Visualize the trading volume changes over time.
Compute and plot the moving average of stock prices.
Calculate the daily return average and visualize it.
Feature Creation:

Add a new column 'Trend' based on the daily returns.
Visualize trend frequency through pie charts.
Examine the correlation between the daily returns of different stocks using a heatmap.
Model Training and Testing:

Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train various machine learning models on the training data.
Evaluate model performance on the testing data.
Result Analysis and Interpretation:

Compare the performance of different models.
Visualize predicted vs. actual stock prices.
Provide insights based on model predictions.
